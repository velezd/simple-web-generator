    My first reagrass_placementlly realistic scene. ŠKODA Forman and background scene, it’s not any specific model,
    I made it using more then dozen different reference images and took parts that I liked.

<strong>Scene overview – grass layout</strong>

Total grass particles: 771800 I don’t have enough VRAM to render this on my GPU. Maybe I should spend more time on optimization or buy new GPU.

Images in gallery on black background were rendered with older materials (blue is oversaturated)
